Alice has a string S with length N and Bob has a string C with length M. Bob gave Alice an array of integers A of size N representing the cost of deleting each letter in strings S. Find the minimum cost T to delete a number of characters(possibly zero) from S so that C doesn't appear as a sub sequence of S.
